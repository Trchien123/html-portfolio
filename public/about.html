<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Huynh Trung Chien, a second year student at Swinburne University of Technology Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City
  Campuses. I am majoring in Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence.
</p>

<p>Beside AI, I am currently taking "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp" course in Udemy. This is because I want
  to get some basic knowledge about web development, which will help me in my future study and projects.
</p>

<p>Another field that I am interested in and currently studying is Cybersecurity, I think that the Cybersecurity field is very
  crucial and neccessary in the future. Moreover, as the advancement of the big data age, Cybersecurity is playing an integral
  role in securing both personal sensitive information and sensitive information of the organizations.
